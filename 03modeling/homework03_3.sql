--		filled any longer because it has no where to go, so the record in this table should be deleted.
-- If an order gets removed from the database, there is no order to handle anymore, so the
--		record in this table should get deleted as well.

-- If a part number gets removed from the database, the record of that part being on
--		a particular order should get deleted as well because it can no longer be a part
--		of that order.
-- If an order is deleted from the database, there is no longer any need for parts for that
--		order, so the record in Part_Orders should be deleted as well.
