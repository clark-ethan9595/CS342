1. Consider the ERD given in Figure 3.21 (The AIRLINE database schema):

	a. Based on what you see in the diagram, explain the difference between flights, flight legs, and leg instances. Please give a short explanatory paragraph.

	b. The names of some of the attributes in this diagram are underlined with dotted lines. You’ll note that this notation is not explained in the Figure 3.14 cheatsheet. What does it mean?
	
	c. You’ll note that the “SEAT” entity has a total participation in the “RESERVATION” relationship (i.e., we would write the cardinality constraint {1,*} on the “LEG_INSTANCE” side of the relationship). Why do you think the database modelers did it this way?
