	the modified table.
Rollback and query.				Query.							Return the same result
Add a new movie and query.		Query.							I expect the first session to have the new movie and the second session to not have the new movie.
Commit.							Query.							Return the same result.


Step 1: SELECT * FROM Movie;
	Both returned 41 rows.

Step 2: DELETE FROM Movie WHERE id = 238071;
		SELECT * FROM Movie;
	This happened just as I expected. The first session deleted the database and then returned only 40 rows from the movie table. The second session still returned 41 rows
		for the movie table query.

Step 3: ROLLBACK;
		SELECT * FROM Movie;
	This happened just as I expected. After doing the rollback command in the first session, the movie table query returned 41 rows for session 1 and session 2.

Step 4: INSERT INTO Movie VALUES (4, 'Ethans Movie', 2017, 9, NULL);
		SELECT * FROM Movie;
	This happened just as I expected. I inserted a new movie in session 1 and the movie table query returned 42 rows, but the movie table query returned 41 rows still.

Step 5: COMMIT;
		SELECT * FROM Movie;
	I committed in session 1 and then the movie table query returned 42 rows. The movie table query returned 42 rows in session 2 as well so they returned the same result.

Experiment a bit with some SQL*Plus sessions, making changes, exiting and restarting the session and then answer the following questions.

	a. Does Oracle handle the transaction life-cycle (see Figure 20.4) with respect to starting and stopping SQL*Plus sessions?

	b. Can we implement any of the ACID properties using START-TRANSACTION/SAVEPOINT/ROLLBACK/COMMIT?
