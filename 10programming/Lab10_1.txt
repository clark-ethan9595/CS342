Exericse 10.1

Experiment a bit with some SQL*Plus sessions, making changes, exiting and restarting the session and then answer the following questions.

	a. Does Oracle handle the transaction life-cycle (see Figure 20.4) with respect to starting and stopping SQL*Plus sessions?

	b. Can we implement any of the ACID properties using START-TRANSACTION/SAVEPOINT/ROLLBACK/COMMIT?
