Manually re-enact the well-known concurrency problems listed below. Note the following before you start.

	- Use separate SQL*Plus sessions to simulate separate threads (as done in the previous exercise).
	- Turn AUTOCOMMIT on, which allows you to demonstrate these concurrency problems at the SQL*Plus command-line.
	- A good test transaction is to try to add 0.2 and/or subtract 0.1 from the rank of one of the movies. You can simulate “reading” the
	current value by selecting it, modifying the value in your head and “writing” the value by updating the record.

Exercise 10.2.a

	- The lost update problem, cf. Figure 20.3.a.
