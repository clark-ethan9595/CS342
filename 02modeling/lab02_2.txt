a. The constraint that I would add would say:
	CHECK ((score = null) or (score is NOT NULL and votes > 1000)).
	This check lets any record with a null score value have any number of votes, but if the
	score record IS NOT NULL, then the number of votes must be more than 1000.

b. One circumstance that I can think of for turning off a constraint for a particular table
	would be for modifying or updating when that table has records that are referencing it.
	This would mean that turning off the foreign key constraint would allow the DBA to do the
	updates that they want to do, update the corresponding referencing records, and then turn back
	on the constraint for the original table. The DBA cannot do the necessary updates while the
	referencing records need something to reference to.
