-- 1. Exercise 5.14
	-- Implement this schema using the Oracle SQL DDL. Please add an item name in the Item table.
	-- Include appropriate constraints and, in particular, specifiy what should be done on deletes (e.g. cascade...).
	--		Justify your implementation in the code comments.
	-- Include 3-5 sample records in each table. You'll need to have sufficient records to drive the queries below,
	--		so it's probably wise to look through the queries so that you will have non-empty and non-NULL results for each of them.

-- 2. Exercise 5.20 a. and c.
	-- Consider only this modified version of the text exercise - What recommendations would you have for CIT if they were considering replacing surrogate student ID numbers with a more natural key?
	--		Either suggest a new form of key or try to convince them that surrogate keys are acceptable.

-- 3. Write the SQL commands to retrieve the following from the customer-order database you built above.
	-- a. All the order dates and amounts for orders made by a customer with a particular name (one that exists in your database),
	--		ordered chronologically by date
	
	-- b. All the customer ID numbers for customers who have made at least one order in the database
	
	-- c. The customer IDs and names of the people who have ordered an item with a particular name (one that exists in your database)
