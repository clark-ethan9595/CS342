Final Project Vision Statement - Ethan Clark

	For my information system project, I am thinking of creating a database to store information regarding a MIAA Basketball Conference
	fantasy league. In this fantasy league, users will get to create a user and join a league to play against other users. Each user
	will only be allowed to be in one league and have only one team. This database will hold information regarding the players in the
	MIAA conference as well as the schools that each player belongs to. Each game the players play in will produce statistics (good
	things like points, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals, but also bad things like turnovers). I am also storing GPA for academic
	purposes because Division 3 schools really pride themselves on academic standards, so we can track things like eligibility for
	these players. I think I will start out with getting information on only a couple players for each time because there are 15
	players on Calvin's team alone, so that would be a lot of data to get every player on every team to start. I will try and get more
	player data as the semester goes along, but for the second project deliverable, I am going to focus on the ERD design and schema of
	my database.

	The likely users of this database will most likely be college students that are attending those schools in the MIAA conference.
	This would be a good way to have some fun with friends at your own college, or even have some cross-school challenges in this MIAA
	fantasy basketball league. This database will also be useful for players or coaches or fans who would want to track how an
	individual player is doing by taking a look at the statistics for that player. Fans of any team in the MIAA would have a good time
	using this database, whether to play with fantasy teams or to check out statistics.
