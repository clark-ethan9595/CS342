Final Project Vision Statement - Ethan Clark

	For my information system project, I am thinking of creating a student-athlete database for Calvin Athletics. I want to be
	able to list the students for the sports teams at Calvin College, some of the individuals statistics for their respective
	sports, schedules for those teams, coach's information, recruits, and even maybe some academic information (because Calvin
	is very focused on the STUDENT-athlete portion). I think this database information system would be complex enough to require
	numerous tables and relationships. I think this database would be different in the sense that it would combine aspects of
	athletics that are separate and hard to connect to date, as in academics, recruiting, schedules, and team and player
	statistics.

	Users for this database could vary in respect to what they would need to be looking at. An overall view of this database
	would be useful for the athletic administration to get information regarding any athlete or team at any time. Users could
	also be coaches, who could focus on their team information or they could use this to store information regarding potential
	recruits. Athletes could use this database to track their statistics for a specific season or sport, or even for their whole
	career, and they could track and store workout information in the database as well. Even those that work for the facility of
	Van Nord Arena could use this to look up team's schedules and know when different teams would be playing in the gym or the
	sports facilities around Calvin.
