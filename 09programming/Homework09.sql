-- Implement the following SQL queries on the IMDBLarge, optimize them using physical database and SQL tuning.

-- For each query, include a short (one-paragraph) discussion that includes the following.
--		The alternate implementation forms you could have used and why you choose the one you did.
--		The indexes your queries use (or don't use) and why they help.
--		The general SQL tuning heuristics you've deployed.

-- Demonstrate what you've accomplished by reviewing the execution plans for each query.

-- For testing purposes, it can be helpful to run these queries on the smaller IMDB; this works provided that you relax the requirements a bit (e.g., directors with more than 2 rather than 200 movies, etc.).

-- 1.
-- Get the movies directed by Clint Eastwood.

-- 2.
-- Get the number of movies directed by each director who's directed more than 200 movies.

-- 3.
-- Get the most popular actors, where actors are designated as popular if their movies have an average rank greater than 8.5 with a movie count of at least 10 movies.
